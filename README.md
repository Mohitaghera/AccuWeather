# AccuWeather
developed a dynamic live weather website that enables users to check the weather conditions of any city in real-time. Users can simply enter the name of their desired city to access accurate weather data instantly. This project highlights my proficiency in web development and my ability to create a user-friendly platform that delivers valuable, real-time information to users.
